To combat this massive loss in workforce a mentorship program is a promising idea. Currently there are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. This is a respectable number of people who can mentor the less experienced staff to help them to prepare for advancement to more senior positions. However, if there is a mass rush of people eligible for retirement deciding to retire before the less experienced employees are ready for advancement, then Pewlett Hackard may have to seek outside candidates for the thousands of positions that will remain unfilled.
